# Planet Symbols (Self-authored, MIT)

This folder contains self-authored minimalist SVGs for common planetary symbols used in demo UI:
- Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn

They are designed by the AIDestinyMaster project team for clarity at small sizes and are not copied from any external icon set. License: MIT.

These SVGs are optional. The app prefers:
1) Font symbols at `assets/fonts/planet_symbols.ttf` (MIT/Apache). If present, they are used in Font mode.
2) Otherwise, a self-authored vector renderer draws shapes directly on Canvas.
3) Unicode symbols are available as an alternative.

If you add a 3rd-party font or SVG set, ensure the license allows embedding (MIT/Apache preferred), and add the source and license text to `NOTICE.txt`.
